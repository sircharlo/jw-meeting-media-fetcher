# JW Meeting Media Fetcher

Welcome! Here is an app that facilitates the downloading of media that will be considered during congregation meetings, for example for personal study, or when using JW Library is not possible for various reasons.

This app can be run as a normal user; settings allow for automatic execution at system startup, making this a practical app for those who like to keep things simple.

## Prerequisites

The app should run as is on most modern computers running Windows, Linux, or Mac. For various technical reasons, the auto-updater does not yet work on Macs, so Mac users will have to periodically check for updates to this app on their own.

## Usage

Simply download the latest [installer](https://github.com/sircharlo/jw-meeting-media-fetcher/releases/latest) and run it. Once the setup is complete, a shortcut to the app will be placed on your desktop. Open the app, and configure the settings as you please. Once you execute the media sync, all downloaded media will be placed in a subfolder called "Meeting Media" in the folder of your choosing. By default, this is set to your desktop.


## Does this app infringe the JW.org Terms of Use?

No, the JW.org [Terms of Use](https://www.jw.org/en/terms-of-use) actually *explicitly allow* this kind of usage. Here is the relevant excerpt from those terms(emphasis mine):
