# JW Meeting Media Fetcher

Welcome! Here is an app that facilitates the downloading of media that will be considered during congregation meetings, for example for personal study, or when using JW Library is not possible for various reasons.

This app can be run as a normal user; settings allow for automatic execution at system startup, making this a practical app for those who like to keep things simple.

## Prerequisites

The app should run as is on mot modern computers running Windows or Linux. Although a Mac version has been compiled, it is as of yet untested and probably doesn't work very well. Feedback from a Mac user would be appreciated!

## Usage

Simply download the latest [installer](https://github.com/sircharlo/jw-meeting-media-fetcher/releases) and run it. Once the setup is complete, a shortcut to the app will be placed on your desktop. Downloaded media is placed on your desktop, in a folder named "Meeting Media".


## Does this app infringe the JW.org Terms of Use?

No, the JW.org [Terms of Use](https://www.jw.org/en/terms-of-use) actually *explicitly allow* this kind of usage. Here is the relevant excerpt from those terms(emphasis mine):
