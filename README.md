# JW Meeting Media Fetcher

Welcome! Here is an app that facilitates the downloading of media for personal study when access to [JW.org](https://www.jw.org) or JW Library is limited, or for playback during congregation meetings.

This is app can be run as a normal user; settings allow for automatic execution at system startup, making this a practical app for those who prefer to keep things simple.

## Prerequisites

The prerequisites are simple enough. You need a Windows computer. Work is underway to release Linux and Mac installers as well; contact me if this is something you'd be interested in.


## Usage

Simply download the installer and run it. A shortcut to the app will be placed on your desktop. Downloaded media is placed on your desktop, in the "Meeting Media" folder.


## Does this infringe the JW.org Terms of Use?

No, the JW.org [Terms of Use](https://www.jw.org/en/terms-of-use) actually *explicitly allow* this. Here is the relevant excerpt (emphasis mine):

>You may not:
>
> Create for distribution purposes, any software applications, tools, or techniques that are specifically made to collect, copy, download, extract, harvest, or scrape data, HTML, images, or text from this site. **(This does *not* prohibit the distribution of free, non-commercial applications designed to download electronic files such as EPUB, PDF, MP3, and MP4 files from public areas of this site.)**

## Help!

If ever you run into any issues with the script, please feel free to let me know.
